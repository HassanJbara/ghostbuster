# Ghostbuster: Detecting Text <i>Ghostwritten</i> by Large Language Models <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15047">[paper]</a> <a href="https://ghostbuster.app">[demo]</a> <a href="https://github.com/vivek3141/ghostbuster-data">[data]</a>

This is a fork of Ghostbuster that has been modified to integrate more easily with other projects.

## Installation

Each of our files are pickled with `python3.10`, so we highly reccomend creating a new conda environment as follows:

```
conda create -n ghostbuster python=3.10
conda activate ghostbuster
```

Then, clone the reponsitory:

```
git clone git@github.com:vivek3141/ghostbuster.git
cd ghostbuster
```

Lastly, install the dependencies and the package:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

You may also need to open a `python` shell to install the following nltk `brown` model:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('brown')
```

## Usage

In order to run a standalone text through Ghostbuster, we provide a `classify.py` file with the following usage:

```
python3 classify.py --file INPUT_FILE_HERE --openai_key OPENAI_KEY
```

To run the experiment files, create a file called `openai.config` in the main directory with the following template:

```javascript
{
    "organization": ORGANIZATION,
    "api_key": API_KEY
}
```

Then, you must generate the cached symbolic data file. This consists of a feature vector for every single feature found through our "symbolic search" method. Running these commands will create binary files in the root directory:

```
python train.py --generate_symbolic_data_four
python train.py --generate_symbolic_data_eval
```

These commands should take a couple hours to run! Then, you can run any of the experiments listed in the `run.py` file.

## Disclaimer

Ghostbusterâ€™s training data, which consists of news, student essay, and creative writing data, is not representative of all writing styles or topics and contains predominantly British and American English text. If you wish to apply Ghostbuster to real-world cases of potential off-limits usage of text generation, such as identifying ChatGPT-written student essays, be wary that incorrect predictions by Ghostbuster are particularly likely in the following cases:

<ul>
<li> For shorter text
<li> In domains that are further from those on which Ghostbuster was trained (e.g., text messages)
<li> For text in varieties of English besides American and British English, or in non-English languages
<li> For text written by non-native speakers of English
<li> For AI-generated text that has been edited or paraphrased by a human
</ul>

No AI-generated text detector is 100% accurate; we strongly discourage incorporation of Ghostbuster into any systems that automatically penalize students or other writers for alleged usage of text generation without human intervention. Privacy: Please be aware that all inputs to Ghostbuster are sent to the OpenAI API, and we also save the inputs for internal testing purposes. Though we will not distribute the data publicly, we cannot guarantee the privacy of any inputs to Ghostbuster.
